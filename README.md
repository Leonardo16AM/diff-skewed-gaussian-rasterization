# Diff Skewed Gaussian Rasterization

This repository is a fork of [Differential Gaussian Rasterization](https://github.com/graphdeco-inria/diff-gaussian-rasterization), originally developed by the GRAPHDECO research group at Inria.

The purpose of this fork is to explore extensions to the original rasterizer, specifically incorporating **skewness** into the Gaussian splatting process.
